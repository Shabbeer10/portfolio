      <p>
        I am a passionate Full Stack Developer with a focus on creating functional and efficient applications. With experience in the MERN stack, along with python and Java, I do my best to create solutions for those who have none.
        I have recently developed an interest in cyber security and mean to make my way into the field, because I believe I can help alot of people that way.

        In my free time, I enjoy keeping fit, spending time with friends and family, and learning more about all things in tech.
